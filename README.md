# Car-Price
This project will tell you the fair price of your car by taking the specifications of your car and its performance. (This project is one of my final projects to get advanced Python degree)
## More Information
#### This project is written in two parts.
#### The first part is about building a Car-Brand database
#### The second part is about machine learning
#### In this project, the TrueCar site was used to obtain the Database. Obviously, only the brands on this site can be priced by the project
